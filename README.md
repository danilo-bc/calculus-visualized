## Julia dependencies
- Pluto
- Zygote

## How to use
Open a Julia terminal and start Pluto
```julia
import Pluto; Pluto.run()
```

Pluto will open in your default browser. Use its interface to navigate to the noteboook you want to explore. When done, close all tabs and finish the Pluto process by typing `ctrl + c` in the Julia REPL terminal.

Pluto should take care of all dependencies.
